# checking for small deformation
# A single element is stretched by 1E-6m in z direction, and by small amounts in x and y directions
# stress_zz = Youngs Modulus*Strain = 2E6*1E-6 = 2 Pa
# tensile_strength is set to 1Pa
# Then the final stress should return to the yeild surface and the maximum principal stress value should be 1pa, and value of plastic strain should be 0.5E-6
